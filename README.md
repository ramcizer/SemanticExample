# SemanticExample
An example of a semantic test of similarity with notes as to results.

A bootcamp excerise to compare two sets of date produced by module en_core_web_sm and en_core_web_md respectively.

The work is not my own, its example code and a test of interpretation. A good example of the working of spacy.
